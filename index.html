                    <p class="steve-text">Steve Jobs: You helped me with my career choice. You helped me organise my
                        life. You helped me beat the boredom of hours on the road. You helped me access knowledge. You
                        helped me stay connected with friends and family. You helped me share my life with those who
                        matter. Thank you, Steve, you are an inspiration. Rest in peace. </p>

                    <p class="steve-text">My deepest condolences to Steve's family and everyone at Apple. I met Steve
                        in 1978, a young kid in blue jeans, a white tee-shirt, and sneakers. If anyone deserved a Nobel
                        Prize, it was Steve. His creative spirit, uncompromising demand for quality, and his sense of
                        aesthetics will be sorely missed.</p>

                    <p class="steve-text">Many want to change the world, and we all do to varying extents. Some for
                        the better, some for the worse, some significantly and dramatically, others less so. Steve Jobs
                        changed the world signifuicantly, dramatically and in many ways for the better. Because of their
                        focus on “Computers for the rest of us” he and Steve Wozniak could have called the company they
                        built “Prometheus Computers.” The Apple II, Lisa, Mac, Newton, iPod, iTunes store, iPod Touch,
                        iPhone, iPad, are, in a sense, like the fire ‘stolen’ in the myth by Prometheus and given to
                        man. Jobs, however, while known for being tough, was not known for being pompous. He will be
                        missed by his family and friends. His ideas will be missed by the rest of us. Goodbye Steve, and
                        thanks.</p>
